      <img src="assets/images/cat.jpg" class="auth-image" alt="Steve Walker">

      <p>I got my start coding HTML and CSS in Florida back in the mid 1990’s. I also taught software classes including Adobe Photoshop, Microsoft Excel and Access, all to the Advanced Level, as well as A+ classes. I also ran a small company coding Web Sites and doing server and network troubleshooting. I left the Computer Industry in the mid-2000’s pursue a successful career in the New York Real Estate Investment Industry. After a period of retirement, I have decided to jump back into the Tech Industry to chase my goal of becoming a Full Stack Programmer.</p>

      <p>In my free time I enjoy World travel having visited countries such as Turkey, Morocco, New Zealand, Australia and all of Europe with my wife and daughter. Our current situation also permits me the flexibility to entertain relocation for job offers in any region of the World. Une seule vie.</p>
