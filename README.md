## Issues encountered completing this assignment:

* I utlized the "clean copy" solution as I severely damaged my original attempting to fix the centering issue.

* No issues getting media tags to resize pages properly. ![Stormtroopocat](https://octodex.github.com/images/stormtroopocat.jpg "The Stormtroopocat")
